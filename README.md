# Bino

This is a website that you can use to create advanced social media profiles to make your life easier when making profiles. 

You can visit the website here : [WEBSITE NOT CREATED YET BECAUSE BINO IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT]


## DISCLAIMER

Only the source code can be seen here and has to be run to find out how the project is doing currently. There is no website yet due to the project being only in early prototype\
Sadly though, I cannot provide any further information on how the website works due to the fact that it is still being worked on

## How to Use

To use this tool, all you have to do is put the bino link in your description/bio, then people can click on it and view your advanced profile created on Bino

### Features That Will be Added:

• A homepage\
• Sign in page\
